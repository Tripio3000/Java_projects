## About Threats
Here I am looking at basic multithreading mechanisms in Java. 
Threads allow you to implement the concept of asynchronous work, where several different loosely coupled tasks are executed “in parallel”.
Any modern client-server application is based on the use of threads.

## How to use:
* javac ex00/Program.java
* java ex00.Program "argument" (in the format "--count=50", in this case program will be executed 50 times)
